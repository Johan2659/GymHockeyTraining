# Session Player UX Improvements

## Overview
Redesigned the session player screen to provide a more engaging and user-friendly experience for hockey and gym training. The focus is on making performance tracking intuitive and motivating for users who will use this screen frequently.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modern Number Picker Dialog**
- **Scroll Picker Interface**: Replaced text input fields with an intuitive scroll picker dialog
- **Reps Selection**: 1-50 range with smooth scrolling
- **Weight Selection**: 0-300kg range with 0.5kg increments for precise weight tracking
- **Smart Defaults**: 
  - Reps default to prescribed exercise value
  - Weight remembers last used value for that exercise
  - Next sets auto-populate with previously used weight

### 2. **Enhanced Set Tracking Cards**
- **Visual Set Cards**: Each set is now displayed as a distinct card with clear visual feedback
- **Completion States**: 
  - Uncompleted sets: Dark background with primary color accents
  - Completed sets: Green background with check icon
- **Quick Actions**: Tap buttons to modify reps/weight, single button to complete set
- **Disabled After Completion**: Once a set is completed, inputs are locked to prevent accidental changes

### 3. **Automatic Rest Timer**
- **Smart Activation**: Timer starts automatically after completing a set (except the last one)
- **Visual Countdown**: Large, easy-to-read timer display with progress bar
- **Orange Theme**: Matches the color scheme from progress_screen.dart for consistency
- **Skip Option**: Users can skip rest if they're ready to continue
- **Per-Exercise Tracking**: Timer is tied to specific exercises, stops when swiping to another

### 4. **Simplified Add/Remove Sets**
- **Icon-Only Controls**: Clean + and - icons at the bottom of performance section
- **Smart Positioning**: Centered for easy thumb access
- **Color-Coded**: 
  - Add (+): Primary color with subtle background
  - Remove (-): Red with warning color (only shows when >1 set exists)
- **Auto-Population**: New sets automatically use last weight value

### 5. **Improved Visual Feedback**
- **Completion Button Behavior**: 
  - Requires all sets to be completed before saving exercise
  - Shows warning if user tries to complete exercise with incomplete sets
  - Enhanced success message with icon
- **Set Status Indicators**:
  - Uncompleted: Numbered badge with primary color
  - Completed: Green check icon in badge
- **Value Display Buttons**: 
  - Clear labels with icons (repeat for reps, dumbbell for weight)
  - Large, tappable areas
  - Disabled state when set is completed

### 6. **Color Scheme Consistency**
- Maintained color palette from progress_screen.dart:
  - Primary color for main actions and highlights
  - Green for completion states
  - Orange for rest timer (matches streak/fire colors)
  - Accent colors for special elements
- Dark theme throughout for gym/hockey environment

## Technical Changes

### State Management
```dart
// Simplified performance tracking
Map<String, List<Map<String, dynamic>>> _exercisePerformances
Map<String, double> _lastWeightUsed

// Rest timer state
Timer? _restTimer
int _restSecondsRemaining
bool _isRestTimerRunning
String? _currentRestExerciseId
```

### New Components
- `NumberPickerDialog`: Reusable scroll picker for numeric input
- `_buildSetCard`: Individual set card with all controls
- `_buildRestTimerCard`: Animated rest timer display
- `_buildValueButton`: Tappable value display for reps/weight

### Key Methods
- `_showRepsPicker`: Opens scroll picker for rep selection
- `_showWeightPicker`: Opens scroll picker for weight selection (with decimal support)
- `_completeSet`: Marks set as done and triggers rest timer
- `_startRestTimer`: Begins countdown with visual feedback
- `_stopRestTimer`/`_skipRestTimer`: Timer control methods

## User Experience Flow

1. **Start Exercise**: User sees all sets with prescribed values
2. **Adjust Values**: Tap on reps or weight to open scroll picker
3. **Complete Set**: Tap check button after finishing set
4. **Rest Period**: Automatic timer starts (can be skipped)
5. **Next Set**: Move to next set, weight auto-populated from previous
6. **Complete Exercise**: After all sets done, save performance
7. **Success Feedback**: Green snackbar with check icon confirms save

## Benefits

✅ **Faster Input**: Scroll pickers are quicker than typing numbers
✅ **Fewer Errors**: No invalid inputs or typos possible
✅ **Better Focus**: Users can track training without distractions
✅ **Motivating**: Visual completion feedback encourages progress
✅ **Professional**: Clean, modern design suitable for serious athletes
✅ **Consistent**: Matches app's overall design language
✅ **Thumb-Friendly**: All controls positioned for one-handed use
✅ **Smart Defaults**: Remembers context to reduce repetitive input

## Color Theme Reference

- **Primary**: App theme primary color (blue-ish)
- **Success**: Green (#4CAF50)
