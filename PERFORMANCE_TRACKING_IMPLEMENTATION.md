# Exercise Performance Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the exercise performance tracking system that allows users to input and store their actual workout performance (sets, reps, and weights) during training sessions.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Data Models (`lib/core/models/models.dart`)

**ExerciseSetPerformance Model:**
- `setNumber`: Track which set (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `reps`: Actual reps performed by the user
- `weight`: Weight used (in kg), optional
- `completed`: Whether the set was completed
- `notes`: Optional notes for the set

**ExercisePerformance Model:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the performance record
- `exerciseId`: Reference to the exercise
- `exerciseName`: Name of the exercise
- `programId`: Reference to the training program
- `week` and `session`: Position in the program
- `timestamp`: When the performance was recorded
- `sets`: List of ExerciseSetPerformance objects
- `duration` and `notes`: Additional metadata

### 2. Data Storage Layer

**LocalExercisePerformanceSource** (`lib/data/datasources/local_exercise_performance_source.dart`)
- Hive-based local storage for exercise performance data
- Methods to save, retrieve, and filter performance records
- Automatic sorting by timestamp (most recent first)

**ExercisePerformanceRepository** (`lib/core/repositories/exercise_performance_repository.dart`)
- Abstract repository interface defining the contract
- Implementation in `lib/data/repositories_impl/exercise_performance_repository_impl.dart`
- Methods:
  - `save()`: Save performance records
  - `getById()`: Retrieve specific performance
  - `getByExerciseId()`: Get all performances for an exercise
  - `getBySession()`: Get all performances for a session
  - `getLastPerformance()`: Get most recent performance for an exercise
  - `getAll()`: Retrieve all performance records
  - `delete()` and `clear()`: Data management

### 3. State Management

**App State Provider Updates** (`lib/features/application/app_state_provider.dart`)
- `saveExercisePerformanceAction`: Provider to save performance data
- `lastPerformanceProvider`: Provider to retrieve last performance for an exercise
- Full integration with existing Riverpod architecture

**Dependency Injection** (`lib/app/di.dart`)
- Registered `ExercisePerformanceRepository` provider
- Available throughout the app via `ref.read(exercisePerformanceRepositoryProvider)`

### 4. Enhanced Session Player UI

**Session Player Screen Updates** (`lib/features/session/presentation/session_player_screen.dart`)

The UI now includes:

1. **Exercise Information Card**
   - Exercise name and number
   - Prescribed details (sets, reps, rest)
   - Last performance history (with weights and reps from previous session)
   - Video tutorial link if available

2. **Performance Input Section**
   - Dynamic set input rows with circular set number badges
   - Text fields for reps and weight for each set
   - Pre-populated with prescribed values
   - Clean, modern design with rounded corners and proper spacing

3. **Add/Remove Set Functionality**
   - `+ Add Set` button to add additional sets beyond prescribed
   - `- Remove Set` button to remove sets if user did fewer
   - Buttons styled with proper colors (red for remove)
   - Minimum of 1 set enforced

4. **Complete Exercise Button**
   - Saves all performance data to storage
   - Marks exercise as completed
   - Shows success/error feedback via SnackBar
   - Updates completion state in real-time

### 5. Data Flow

```
User Input (TextField) 
  → State (TextEditingController) 
  → ExerciseSetPerformance Model 
  → ExercisePerformance Model 
  → Repository (save) 
  → Hive Storage
```

**Retrieval:**
```
Hive Storage 
  → Repository (getLastPerformance) 
  → Provider (lastPerformanceProvider) 
  → UI (displays historical data)
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between models, repositories, and UI
2. **Type Safety**: Strongly typed models with JSON serialization
3. **Reactive**: Riverpod providers automatically update UI when data changes
4. **Persistent**: All data stored locally in Hive database
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new performance metrics or analytics

## User Experience Features

1. **Pre-filled Values**: Reps field starts with prescribed values for convenience
2. **Historical Context**: Shows last performance to help users track progress
3. **Flexible Input**: Users can add or remove sets based on actual performance
4. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Set numbers in circular badges
   - Completed exercises turn green
   - Success/error messages via SnackBars
5. **Optional Weight**: Weight field can be left empty for bodyweight exercises

## Technical Highlights

### State Management
- Uses local state for text controllers and UI state
- Riverpod for data fetching and persistence
- Proper disposal of TextEditingControllers to prevent memory leaks

### Data Validation
- `int.tryParse()` and `double.tryParse()` for safe number parsing
- Handles empty weight fields gracefully
- Validates minimum set count (at least 1 set required)

### Performance
- Lazy initialization of text controllers
- Efficient state updates with `setState()`
- Optimized widget rebuilds using keys and proper separation

## Storage Schema

**Hive Box**: `exercise_performance`

**Record Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "back_squat_1698765432000",
  "exerciseId": "back_squat",
  "exerciseName": "Back Squat",
  "programId": "attacker",
  "week": 0,
  "session": 0,
  "timestamp": "2024-10-31T12:30:00.000Z",
  "sets": [
    {
      "setNumber": 1,
      "reps": 5,
      "weight": 100.0,
      "completed": true,
      "notes": null
    },
    {
      "setNumber": 2,
      "reps": 5,
      "weight": 100.0,
      "completed": true,
      "notes": null
    }
  ],
  "duration": null,
  "notes": null
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to this system:

1. **Performance Analytics**: 
   - Track 1RM (one-rep max) calculations
   - Volume tracking (sets × reps × weight)
   - Progress graphs over time

2. **Advanced Metrics**:
   - RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
   - Rest timer between sets
   - Set-specific notes

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Quick weight increment buttons (+5kg, +10kg)
   - Previous performance comparison in real-time
   - Set completion checkboxes

4. **Social Features**:
   - Share workout performance
   - Compare with training partners
   - Leaderboards for specific exercises

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test repository methods with mock data sources
2. **Widget Tests**: Test input fields, button interactions, and state updates
3. **Integration Tests**: Test complete flow from input to storage
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty weight fields
   - Invalid number inputs
   - Adding/removing sets dynamically
   - Multiple exercises in same session
