## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. 🎯 **Sticky Global Rest Timer**

**Problem:** Timer disappeared when switching between exercises to check something.

**Solution:** Implemented a persistent sticky timer at the top of the screen.

**Features:**
- **Always Visible:** Timer remains visible even when navigating between exercises
- **Top Position:** Strategically placed at the very top for maximum visibility
- **Persistent State:** Timer continues running regardless of which exercise you're viewing
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Orange gradient background with border to stand out

**UX Benefits:**
- ✅ Never lose track of rest time
- ✅ Can review next exercise while resting
- ✅ Doesn't interrupt training flow
- ✅ Professional gym timer experience

---

### 2. ⏯️ **Advanced Timer Controls**

**New Controls:**
- **Play/Pause Button:** Pause and resume rest timer at any time
- **Restart Button:** Reset timer back to original duration
- **Skip Button:** Skip rest period when ready to continue
- **Visual Feedback:** Icons change based on state (timer/pause icon)

**Timer Display:**
- Large, easy-to-read countdown (24pt font)
- Progress bar showing time elapsed
- Current state indicator (paused/running)
- Orange color scheme for visibility

**Use Cases:**
- Pause timer to check form or watch a video
- Restart if you need more rest
- Skip when feeling recovered early
- Professional control like gym equipment

### 3. 🎯 **Auto-Complete Sets**

**Smart Completion Logic:**
When both reps AND weight values are entered, the set automatically completes!

**Flow:**
1. User taps Reps → Selects value → Dialog closes
2. User taps Weight → Selects value → Dialog closes
3. **✨ Set automatically marks as completed**
4. Rest timer starts automatically (if not last set)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One less tap per set (saves time)
- ✅ Smooth, uninterrupted workflow
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback (green state)
- ✅ Automatic rest timer trigger
- ✅ Feels intelligent and responsive

**Smart Conditions:**
- Only auto-completes if BOTH values are > 0
- Only auto-completes if set is not already completed
- Manual complete button still available if needed

---

### 4. 📐 **Centered Value Display**

**Improvement:** All values in reps and weight fields are now center-aligned.

**What Changed:**
- Value text: Center-aligned
- Label (with icon): Center-aligned
- Better visual balance
- Easier to scan quickly

**Visual Example:**
```
Before:           After:
┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│🔄 Reps  │      │  🔄 Reps │
│10       │  →   │    10    │
└─────────┘      └─────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better aesthetics
- ✅ Easier to read at a glance
- ✅ Professional app appearance
- ✅ Balanced design

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```dart
// Timer state with pause support
Timer? _restTimer
int _restSecondsRemaining
int _restTimerDuration  // Original duration for restart
bool _isRestTimerRunning
bool _isRestTimerPaused
String? _currentRestExerciseId

// Smart weight tracking
Map<String, double> _lastWeightUsed
```

### Key Methods
```dart
void _startRestTimer(int duration, String exerciseId)
void _pauseRestTimer()
void _resumeRestTimer()
void _restartRestTimer()
void _stopRestTimer()
void _skipRestTimer()
void _autoCompleteSet(Exercise exercise, int setIndex)
```

### Auto-Complete Logic
- Triggered after value selection in picker
- Checks both reps > 0 AND weight > 0
- Only auto-completes uncompleted sets
- Automatically starts rest timer
- Provides smooth, seamless UX

## User Experience Flow

### Typical Set Flow:
1. **Tap Reps** → Scroll picker opens → Select value
2. **Tap Weight** → Scroll picker opens → Select value
3. **✨ Auto-Complete** → Set turns green, rest timer starts at top
4. **Rest Period** → Timer visible, can pause/restart/skip
5. **Next Set** → Weight pre-filled from previous set
6. **Repeat** → Smooth, fast workflow

### Timer Interaction:
1. **Rest Starts** → Sticky timer appears at top
2. **Switch Exercise** → Timer stays visible and running
3. **Need More Time?** → Tap restart to reset
4. **Form Check?** → Tap pause while reviewing
5. **Ready Early?** → Tap skip to continue
6. **Timer Ends** → Automatically closes

---

## Design Consistency

### Color Scheme (matching progress_screen.dart):
- **Primary:** Blue tones for main actions
- **Success:** Green for completed states
- **Warning:** Orange for timer/rest periods
- **Accent:** Gold/Yellow for highlights
- **Background:** Dark theme throughout

### Typography:
- Large countdown: 24pt bold (orange)
